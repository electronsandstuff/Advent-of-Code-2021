# Advent of Code Solutions, 2021
Here are my solutions to Advent of Code 2021.
The problem statements can be found at the challenge's website ([https://adventofcode.com/2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)).
Each day is organized into its own folder that includes my solution as the python file `puzzles.py` and the problem input I was given.

To run my code, first install its dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
Then, each solution should be run from the directory it is stored in.
The problem solution will be printed to stdout.
